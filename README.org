My dotfiles are here! All of my various window manager and program configs are here for you gous, and me as well, to access at any time. Each set of configs is based on one central theme with the various configs specific to each window manager and program inside. Feel free to browse through 'em all and find a theme you like. Maybe you will be inspired by one of my configs and create your own. Whatever the case may be, they are all here for you guys to use or reference.
