#+TITLE: Link Does Mods Dotfiles
These are all my dotfiles for each window manager I use.
Each is configured specifically to my liking with custom themes, color schemes, and more!

My dotfiles are configured with around the same keybindings.
I first started with Xmonad, so all keybindings are based on the
Xmonad keybindings I have set. They are all configured with the same
color scheme and wallpaper so each look the same. These are all here for use as a
reference or just for easy acess so if I ever distro-hop (probably
not ever going to anytime soon), they will be here for me to access.
